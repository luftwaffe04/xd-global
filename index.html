					<p>In a <span>blue planet</span> with 71% covered by the sea, mankind was born, grows, and develops self-civilization in a green blue.</p>
					<p>But for them, too, there was a constant ambition and greed. Under the flow of seemingly peaceful world, the undercurrent of history began to flow vigorously.</p>
					<p>Finally, in the middle of the unknown equatorial sea, and against the overwhelming power of the enemies, each camp began to fight alone, but the result was very terrible.</p>
					<p>Humanity has lost more than 90% of its maritime control, and science and technology and vitality have begun to decline rapidly.</p>
					<p>Humanity felt deep frustration with the advent of the sea and unknown enemies, and furthermore, they began to call them <span>Seiren</span> deep in the deep waters.</p>
					<p>After a long time, each camp has abandoned its past feelings to regain its glory, and to organize a third military organization, the <span>Azur Lane</span>.</p>
					<p>The purpose of the Azur Lane is as follows.</p>
					<p class="point">It will collect and share the technical power and resources of each camp, organize elite units capable of fighting against Seiren, and recover the lost seas.</p>
